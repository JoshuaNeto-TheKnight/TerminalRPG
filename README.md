# TerminalRPG
A little side project to work on while I work things out, don't expect a AAA quality code

Currently has:
- A opening sequence
- Choices introduction
- Choice based status up
- Encounter system
- Fight mechanic (W.I.P focus)
- Enemy actually fighting back

Pretending to add:
- Skills added to your loadout in intro
- Guard system
- Rewards (money/items/etcetera)
# Note to self:
Git terminal steps...
