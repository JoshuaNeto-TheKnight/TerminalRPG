# TerminalRPG
A little side project to work on while I work things out in University, don't expect a AAA quality code

Currently has:
- A opening sequence
- Choices introduction
- Choice based status up
- Encounter system
- Fight mechanic (W.I.P focus)
- Enemy actually fighting back

Pretending to add:
- Skills added to your loadout in intro
- Guard system
- Rewards (money/items/etcetera)

# Kept you waiting huh?
I've been quite inactive as I have been practically been incapacitated by the responsibilities of life and no computer at all.
Its been quite rough for me but why cares, you're here to see the code.
I will be in a bit of a slow pace but hopefully I can do more stuff.
